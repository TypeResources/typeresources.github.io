* **Font weight:** Set weight by writing e.g. `Open Sans:800`.
* **OpenType Features:** You can preview opentype features by typing e.g. `salt, ss01, tnum`
* **Zoom:** The font size is set relative to viewport width but you can make it relativly bigger/smaller adjusting the relative size value, e.g. `2` for a preview twice as big.
* **Settings are saved** Your settings are automagically saved in the browser.
